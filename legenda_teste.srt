00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:05,670
Hello my friends today I'll show you how to embed javascript scripts on your website and in the same

2

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:14,630
time I'll show you how to do it the way that will make your website load really really faster.

3

00:00:14,640  -->  00:00:19,390
It can even save about 1 to 5 seconds.

4

00:00:19,410  -->  00:00:23,610
It depends on how big your website is on loading speed.

5

00:00:23,700  -->  00:00:27,170
So it's very important to do it properly.

6

00:00:27,430  -->  00:00:27,920
OK.

7

00:00:28,110  -->  00:00:29,830
So how to do it.

8

00:00:30,120  -->  00:00:39,680
You can insert your code in back to the HMO internally or externally.

9

00:00:39,940  -->  00:00:48,300
I show you now the internal way how to do it you are going to use the script doc like that and then

10

00:00:48,540  -->  00:00:53,420
between the opening and closing tag you just type the script.

11

00:00:53,550  -->  00:00:56,570
So for instance I would type all.

12

00:00:56,760  -->  00:00:59,440
And then we'll just type test.

13

00:00:59,710  -->  00:01:02,540
This is the most simple script.

14

00:01:02,550  -->  00:01:04,240
It doesn't matter what is it.

15

00:01:04,260  -->  00:01:08,400
What is the function or is this parentheses What is that.

16

00:01:08,700  -->  00:01:13,430
All things around here that semicon other things like that we will talk about all these things later

17

00:01:13,460  -->  00:01:13,710
.

18

00:01:13,920  -->  00:01:21,190
Just think about it as a script that's going to alert the person on the Web site and say test or either

19

00:01:21,290  -->  00:01:21,680
at all.

20

00:01:21,720  -->  00:01:22,660
Hello.

21

00:01:22,890  -->  00:01:31,770
And now when we were on the stakeout and we used this here we want to use the browser I'm using Firefox

22

00:01:31,800  -->  00:01:36,290
and White Creek play as you can see we have got here now.

23

00:01:36,330  -->  00:01:37,230
Hello.

24

00:01:37,640  -->  00:01:39,310
The window saying hello.

25

00:01:39,390  -->  00:01:40,010
OK.

26

00:01:40,200  -->  00:01:43,640
And there's a can see then I can see the content of our website.

27

00:01:43,870  -->  00:01:44,470
OK.

28

00:01:44,640  -->  00:01:45,930
So that's how it works.

29

00:01:45,930  -->  00:01:51,220
We had good screen that is doing something like that and that's doing it internally.

30

00:01:51,510  -->  00:01:52,290
Right.

31

00:01:52,770  -->  00:01:54,900
You can also post the script later.

32

00:01:54,900  -->  00:01:58,800
So for example here and there are some differences because of it.

33

00:01:58,830  -->  00:02:04,890
But first let's think about even thinking about putting something internally.

34

00:02:04,890  -->  00:02:10,830
These are situations when we want to do something like that you want to do things like that very rarely

35

00:02:10,830  -->  00:02:16,560
when you want to put something into the screen in that exact.

36

00:02:16,770  -->  00:02:18,450
And only in that situation.

37

00:02:18,450  -->  00:02:18,930
Why.

38

00:02:18,990  -->  00:02:24,790
Because when you do something like that that code is not gonna be cached.

39

00:02:24,920  -->  00:02:27,110
This is that what cached.

40

00:02:27,380  -->  00:02:33,450
OK it's not going to go into the cache which is a temporary memory of your browser.

41

00:02:33,840  -->  00:02:37,150
And because of it this code is gonna be loaded.

42

00:02:37,200  -->  00:02:42,990
Each time the user go to another side of your website.

43

00:02:43,430  -->  00:02:45,080
So it's gonna slow your website right.

44

00:02:45,090  -->  00:02:48,230
So it's a good idea to have it in one place.

45

00:02:48,270  -->  00:02:50,040
So for example like here.

46

00:02:50,540  -->  00:02:52,850
Well we could do it like that.

47

00:02:53,160  -->  00:02:56,180
So we want to decode to be here.

48

00:02:56,340  -->  00:03:00,470
We don't want it to be like that and we want to import it.

49

00:03:00,510  -->  00:03:01,750
So how to do that.

50

00:03:01,920  -->  00:03:10,110
Well we can do something like type something like script and then we can use that attribute as our see

51

00:03:10,260  -->  00:03:13,390
from that which stands for source.

52

00:03:13,470  -->  00:03:15,400
And here we tag the source.

53

00:03:15,420  -->  00:03:17,940
So for example like that.

54

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:23,310
And now we just imported this file here.

55

00:03:23,460  -->  00:03:29,570
And when we refresh it as you can see we can see you see a hello here pretty easy right.

56

00:03:29,580  -->  00:03:36,970
So it's the external way of doing this Fink in all HDMI.

57

00:03:37,020  -->  00:03:46,230
We had to type here also something like pipe and say that it is that javascript script by but by default

58

00:03:46,230  -->  00:03:46,830
default.

59

00:03:46,860  -->  00:03:51,260
Now the screen is javascript Francine's the HD XML file.

60

00:03:51,340  -->  00:03:51,980
OK.

61

00:03:52,230  -->  00:03:56,850
You don't need to think about things like that anymore.

62

00:03:57,770  -->  00:04:02,070
But there is as well still one small problem.

63

00:04:02,070  -->  00:04:02,870
What is it.

64

00:04:03,000  -->  00:04:04,440
Well look at this.

65

00:04:04,530  -->  00:04:08,490
When I reload this website you can say hello and then when I click OK.

66

00:04:08,850  -->  00:04:11,120
Our Web site content is loaded.

67

00:04:11,460  -->  00:04:21,520
When I put this here as you can see our contard is already loaded and well I can see then hello.

68

00:04:21,750  -->  00:04:25,710
Why something like that happens because.

69

00:04:25,950  -->  00:04:31,110
Well I will tell you now how exactly your web page is loaded.

70

00:04:31,230  -->  00:04:32,210
First thing.

71

00:04:32,430  -->  00:04:40,430
You as a user would connect to your website and then you would download your HDMI Alfar.

72

00:04:40,440  -->  00:04:49,830
So for example index dot h dot HMO and then something with is called a parser which is processing and

73

00:04:49,920  -->  00:04:51,930
interpreting everything inside.

74

00:04:51,930  -->  00:05:01,870
So for example tocks when it means something like scrape it stops totally executing well parsing other

75

00:05:01,880  -->  00:05:02,150
film.

76

00:05:02,140  -->  00:05:07,850
So if the script is here it will go to HDMI.

77

00:05:07,950  -->  00:05:10,840
So it doesn't change the HTML document the head also.

78

00:05:10,880  -->  00:05:16,830
I have the additional information of our of our website of of these Web site overtight.

79

00:05:16,840  -->  00:05:19,850
OK so I have to add the title world for our user.

80

00:05:19,880  -->  00:05:20,370
OK.

81

00:05:20,440  -->  00:05:30,460
All of his you think that the cursor like that viewport also this is for web responsive web design and

82

00:05:31,210  -->  00:05:32,150
all script.

83

00:05:32,200  -->  00:05:40,540
OK so before going here I should go and execute everything inside it and then go to the body section

84

00:05:40,540  -->  00:05:41,070
.

85

00:05:41,470  -->  00:05:48,460
And now you might be like hey this is just one line is not gonna slow it doesn't matter.

86

00:05:48,540  -->  00:05:50,460
Well in that situation.

87

00:05:50,460  -->  00:05:52,230
The worst the if the website was like that.

88

00:05:52,250  -->  00:05:52,770
OK.

89

00:05:52,960  -->  00:05:56,090
But now imagine that your web site is really big.

90

00:05:56,290  -->  00:05:56,930
OK.

91

00:05:57,010  -->  00:06:03,580
Really really there is like five hundred of cards and you don't have only one script the joyous.

92

00:06:03,620  -->  00:06:07,890
You have got a good like 50 or 10 what happens.

93

00:06:08,200  -->  00:06:08,550
Wow.

94

00:06:08,590  -->  00:06:13,290
Imagine now something like that that you would go to all these scripts.

95

00:06:13,420  -->  00:06:18,080
And then after executing all the things inside it would LoDo happened.

96

00:06:18,460  -->  00:06:24,350
What would happen what your user would just not see almost anything.

97

00:06:24,380  -->  00:06:25,170
Right.

98

00:06:25,660  -->  00:06:27,810
And after loading everything.

99

00:06:28,060  -->  00:06:33,900
Then he would see the content of the website which is very bad right.

100

00:06:34,330  -->  00:06:36,330
But for our users.

101

00:06:36,340  -->  00:06:38,280
He would just leave probably our Web site.

102

00:06:38,290  -->  00:06:41,090
We cannot allow something like that.

103

00:06:41,120  -->  00:06:44,750
That's why most people just bought this scripts here.

104

00:06:44,810  -->  00:06:53,340
But there is a small problem because when he puts scripts here we do not download them instantly.

105

00:06:53,340  -->  00:06:57,760
Right so when the content of the website is loaded it's gonna be loaded down.

106

00:06:57,820  -->  00:06:58,880
Right.

107

00:06:58,900  -->  00:07:01,990
It's not so bad in most situations.

108

00:07:02,040  -->  00:07:05,120
Mobot well imagine that there are ominous scripts also.

109

00:07:05,120  -->  00:07:10,640
So then they are downloaded a bit later so that does not go right.

110

00:07:11,260  -->  00:07:16,280
And sometimes the scripts are doing something with the layout of your website.

111

00:07:16,270  -->  00:07:22,090
So they are changing something the Chloris takes other things like that they are moving something to

112

00:07:22,100  -->  00:07:23,060
other place.

113

00:07:23,360  -->  00:07:31,050
And now imagine that the user with the script here would just see the content of your website and this

114

00:07:31,040  -->  00:07:33,950
content these are change on his eyes.

115

00:07:34,150  -->  00:07:34,800
Eyes right.

116

00:07:34,790  -->  00:07:40,570
He would just look at his Web site and he's going to change one of that Jasc is file is going to be

117

00:07:40,570  -->  00:07:40,980
loaded.

118

00:07:41,050  -->  00:07:42,170
That's also bad.

119

00:07:42,440  -->  00:07:45,700
So work what to do how to how to change it.

120

00:07:45,700  -->  00:07:48,690
Some people will put something skeer something here.

121

00:07:48,880  -->  00:07:49,780
Yeah.

122

00:07:50,080  -->  00:07:58,410
But because of HDMI five we have got something what is called a new attribute with this which is called

123

00:07:58,620  -->  00:08:06,890
as sync which stands for synchronous I would type this word here as soon Crone's.

124

00:08:07,060  -->  00:08:08,230
Right.

125

00:08:09,250  -->  00:08:18,450
And what it means that discreate is gonna be loaded in the same time when Or other things are gonna

126

00:08:18,460  -->  00:08:18,910
be loaded.

127

00:08:18,910  -->  00:08:19,230
Right.

128

00:08:19,250  -->  00:08:27,980
It's not gonna wait for the script to be executed which is by default how browsers are loading your

129

00:08:28,290  -->  00:08:34,360
sites and it's just that you are right you are just putting this thing and everything works fine.

130

00:08:34,580  -->  00:08:38,350
But be careful if you have more than one screen.

131

00:08:38,360  -->  00:08:42,610
So you have something like that stupid ones get screwed to keep free.

132

00:08:42,620  -->  00:08:47,790
And for example your user will download this one first.

133

00:08:47,840  -->  00:08:54,350
It's gonna be a cute at first is not going to be executed then like there's been days than these then

134

00:08:54,830  -->  00:08:55,500
bam bam bam bam.

135

00:08:55,510  -->  00:08:58,000
Right because of it.

136

00:08:58,290  -->  00:09:09,040
It's a good idea to use the word like defer which is the same as as saying Coroneos but it's gonna make

137

00:09:09,460  -->  00:09:12,350
it run one by one OK.

138

00:09:12,370  -->  00:09:13,420
It's up.

139

00:09:13,780  -->  00:09:19,630
Wait for disk scripts to execute in that order.

140

00:09:20,680  -->  00:09:23,140
So when I do it like that.

141

00:09:23,140  -->  00:09:29,890
Now as you can see when I reload these Web site we can see that the content is loaded and we can see

142

00:09:29,890  -->  00:09:31,590
the help right.

143

00:09:32,140  -->  00:09:33,260
It's working like that.

144

00:09:33,260  -->  00:09:38,440
Now if I remove this word as you can see we don't have content.

145

00:09:38,570  -->  00:09:40,030
We have good content after people.

146

00:09:40,030  -->  00:09:41,150
OK.

147

00:09:41,500  -->  00:09:51,990
So this is the best solution you can have to do something like that and I suggest you to have all five

148

00:09:52,020  -->  00:09:52,220
.

149

00:09:52,390  -->  00:10:01,240
Well all scripts in an external source like that because well it's easier to maintain your code done

150

00:10:01,340  -->  00:10:02,120
right.

151

00:10:02,180  -->  00:10:06,920
You have got the javascript you know other files the many other files so it's easier to maintain you

152

00:10:06,940  -->  00:10:14,470
know where if your script is gonna be cached so it means that your website is gonna load faster and

153

00:10:14,500  -->  00:10:16,120
well.

154

00:10:16,330  -->  00:10:26,310
You have to also remember that to not to create too many javascript files because if you have managed

155

00:10:26,320  -->  00:10:32,720
javascript files Well it's easier to maintain your project but your web website will also load slower

156

00:10:33,130  -->  00:10:42,140
because if you have a javascript Feis and HD HD to be protocol is allowing you to only download about

157

00:10:42,160  -->  00:10:44,080
two files at once.

158

00:10:44,120  -->  00:10:52,210
It means that there are going to be many requests to your server when the user is visiting your website

159

00:10:53,330  -->  00:11:00,170
and because of it well and that because the requests are the slowest Fink's because you have you know

160

00:11:00,250  -->  00:11:06,240
the user have to connect to the server where is your website and then go back.

161

00:11:06,350  -->  00:11:09,160
This is something that is taking the longest time.

162

00:11:09,590  -->  00:11:14,240
And when you have many javascript FAEs for example and you have to do like four times something like

163

00:11:14,240  -->  00:11:22,090
that which is maybe sometimes when the server is very far one second just for you know not downloading

164

00:11:22,100  -->  00:11:24,020
but just for connecting.

165

00:11:24,800  -->  00:11:27,870
So its taking a lot of time and because of video.

166

00:11:27,910  -->  00:11:33,470
So he's got a lot faster so the best Web site will be just one javascript file so it will be great if

167

00:11:33,460  -->  00:11:39,980
you had many javascript files and then to maintain your code easier.

168

00:11:40,070  -->  00:11:46,250
And then at the end when you want to put them on the web server you want to connect them but you know

169

00:11:46,250  -->  00:11:51,160
connecting something like that every time when you change something what we do it takes much time.

170

00:11:51,160  -->  00:11:56,560
So most time most people do not do it but you can use something what is called Ganji Yes which is the

171

00:11:56,570  -->  00:12:01,020
task manager that would do it automatically for you.

172

00:12:01,030  -->  00:12:03,360
I get all of the calls about this thing also.

173

00:12:03,650  -->  00:12:05,220
But if you want well you can do it.

174

00:12:05,240  -->  00:12:07,080
Also some manwell right.

175

00:12:07,450  -->  00:12:14,440
OK so the best thing to sum up is to put the script here in the head because it will be the fastest

176

00:12:15,010  -->  00:12:23,650
but you have to remember to put these key this attribute otherwise it will not be discussed.

177

00:12:24,400  -->  00:12:29,670
And well you can check how is it supported because no its from 8 to 5.

178

00:12:29,810  -->  00:12:36,170
You can go to it can I use dot com and type you s synchronous and here you can type your can for it

179

00:12:36,180  -->  00:12:36,320
.

180

00:12:36,560  -->  00:12:44,860
And as you can see when you go to for example Internet Explorer Well Internet Explorer 6 and 7 is not

181

00:12:44,870  -->  00:12:52,060
supported 8 and 9 as you can see Firefox's of Firefox is not supported but when you add all these numbers

182

00:12:52,660  -->  00:12:56,190
it depends where you live right.

183

00:12:56,400  -->  00:13:02,330
And probably like to free people on one hand 100 coming to your Web site.

184

00:13:02,360  -->  00:13:08,080
That will not support it but you need to remember that you are helping all other users to load your

185

00:13:08,090  -->  00:13:09,680
website faster right.

186

00:13:09,710  -->  00:13:11,940
Well they will see your web on the way.

187

00:13:11,970  -->  00:13:21,340
If you put it here right but you will make enjoy your website more for users with the new one with the

188

00:13:21,350  -->  00:13:22,400
new browsers.

189

00:13:22,510  -->  00:13:28,930
I think that users that all browsers and those that do not enjoy it as such.

190

00:13:29,500  -->  00:13:35,620
The Internet as the guys with the new browser these will make them change it faster.

191

00:13:36,320  -->  00:13:38,660
Your website will load anyway.

192

00:13:38,890  -->  00:13:41,130
OK thats on that lesson thank you very much.
